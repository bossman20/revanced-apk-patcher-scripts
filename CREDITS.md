## ReVanced Team

This project is built entirely on the incredible work of the **ReVanced Team** and community. The scripts in this repository are merely convenience wrappers around their powerful tools.

### Official ReVanced Repositories

All core functionality comes from these official ReVanced projects:

#### 🛠️ [ReVanced CLI](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-cli)

The command-line application that powers the patching process. This is the core tool that actually modifies the APK files.

**License**: GPL-3.0  
**Maintainers**: ReVanced Team

#### 🔧 [ReVanced Patches](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches)

The collection of patches that add features, remove ads, and customize Android applications. This includes all the YouTube and Google Photos patches used by our scripts.

**License**: GPL-3.0  
**Maintainers**: ReVanced Team

#### 📱 [ReVanced Manager](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-manager)

The official Android application for managing ReVanced patches. If you prefer a GUI on your Android device instead of command-line scripts, check this out!

#### 🔐 [GmsCore (MicroG)](https://github.com/ReVanced/GmsCore)

The ReVanced fork of MicroG, required for patched YouTube to work properly. This provides Google services functionality without the official Google Play Services.
